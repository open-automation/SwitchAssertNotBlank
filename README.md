# SwitchAssertNotBlank
Check if certain variables have blank values or not. The idea is to make it really easy to check if values you're expecting to be there (whether in private data or in a dataset) are there.
## To do
- In the future, I want to add more types of asserts. Ensure that values are numeric, for example.

# Variable Assert
Check if certain variables have the values you expect. Helpful for archiving and injecting.

## Flow element properties
### Tag
Set a human-readable tag for the variable you're attempting to validate.

### Variable
Enter a Switch variable, which could be a dataset value, Private Data, etc... This is the value that will be checked.

### Assert Not Blank
If set to "Yes", it will fail if the value is blank.

### Assert Acceptable Values
If entered, it will check against a list of pre-defined acceptable values.

## To do
- In the future, I want to add more types of asserts. Ensure that values are numeric, for example.
